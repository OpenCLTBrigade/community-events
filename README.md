# Community Events
Combining community event calendars from around Mecklenburg county

## What is this?

Currently there are a few community organizations throughout Mecklenburg County that have event calendars on their website but don't publish the raw data for them. Because of this you can't subscribe to their calendars and you also have to spend time remembering and accessing multiple websites to find and attend events offered by community services.

## Project goal

Without clean, structured data, it's difficult to piece together a simple resource for residents to find events in their community. While complexity and inconsistency in the ways events are published on some websites, we might not be able to generate calendar feeds or match the search capabilities of the individual sites, but we strive to build a single spot for residents to find events near them. 

Ideally this application will show organizations what's possible when their event lists are easier to access. We hope easier access to these schedules will also help draw more residents to their public events.
