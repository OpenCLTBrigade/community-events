# How to contribute to Community Events

Thank you in advance for making it this far. We are constantly in need of volunteer developers to help improve this project.

## Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/OpenCLTBrigade/community-events/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/OpenCLTBrigade/community-events/issues/new/choose) using the *Bug report* template. Fill in as much relevant information as possible, adding a **code sample**, **screenshot/gif** capture, or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Ensure the feature request was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/OpenCLTBrigade/community-events/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new issue using the *Feature request* template. Fill in as much relevant information as possible.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or implements a feature?

* Make the change in your own private [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of the project.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
